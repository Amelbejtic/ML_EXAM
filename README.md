# Machine Learning Exam 2025 - Compulsory Assignment (R)

This repository contains our exam in Machine Learning where we worked in R. The project covers a wide range of topics, from predictive modeling and classification to unsupervised learning and network analysis, all implemented in R.

I've added another folder containing all code we went through for the course. We handed in the assignment, where our final Exam was oral. Weight was partially on the assignment, but mostly on the final oral exam, where we drew a random topic we had to present without any preperation or examination aids

## Project Overview
The project is divided into five main problems, each focusing on different aspects of the machine learning pipeline:

* **Predictive Modeling (Problem 1):** Predicting university applications using OLS and **LASSO** regression to handle high-dimensional data.
* **Classification (Problem 2):** Comparing **Logistic Regression** and **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** to predict bank loan approvals.
* **Network Analysis (Problem 3):** Estimating precision matrices using the **SPACE estimator** to analyze dependencies in the stock market (S&P 500).
* **Theory & Simulation (Problem 4):** A simulation study exploring the **Bias-Variance Tradeoff** and the behavior of test/training errors.
* **Unsupervised Learning (Problem 5):** Comparing **Spectral Clustering** and **k-means** on non-convex datasets to evaluate clustering performance.

## Key Methods & Technologies
* **Languages:** R
* **Libraries:** `glmnet` (LASSO/Ridge), `caret` (Model training), `space` (Precision matrices), `igraph` (Network visualization), `forecast`.

## Repository Structure
* **`/scripts`**: Contains the full `.Rmd` (R Markdown) script with all code and data processing.
* **`/docs`**: Contains the final exam report in PDF format, including detailed mathematical explanations and results.
* **`College.csv`**: The dataset used for the predictive modeling task.
